# Rest API testing using Rest-Assured Java Framework

- The only discrepancies that I am seeing in the API is that hd parameter is not there in request body and I also did not find hd parameter in the NASA documents. The API requests are passing successfully without hd parameter so hd is optional. Not sure what is hd key and what should be it's value.
